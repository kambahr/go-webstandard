# A Go website template

## Webstandard is a practical website template that lays down the groundwork for a full featured Go website. 

It uses the original Go net/http along with native javascript with bootstrap/jquery to demonstrate rendering dynamic content.
It also suggests points on security and avoiding the too many open files error.

An image gallery is included to further show how html can be rendered via Go and placed on html pages.  

To run the website:

- Start a shell window.
- go build -o webstandard && ./webstandard --portno 1265
- Navigate to http://localhost:1265
